# ChatApplication
An iOS app and computer program using Swift and Python that allows phones to chat with computers over LAN using TCP and a client-server architecture.

This project was developed in 2019 for a networking concurrent enrollment course. The code has not been maintained and updates to Swift might prevent it from working as expected. To see functionality of this project, see the uploaded video which demonstrates its performance.
