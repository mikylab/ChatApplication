# ChatApplication
An iOS app and computer program using Swift and Python that allows phones to chat with computers over LAN using TCP and a client-server architecture.

This project was developed in 2019 for a networking concurrent enrollment course. This was a learning project that was supported by instructor. The project goal to design a LAN for a fake company.The requirements were to develop a chat system that would extend chat functionality from just between two computers to between a computer a mobile smartphone. The computer operated as the server and opened up the initial TCP socket. The iPhone app then used that IP address to connect to the computer. Once the connection was formed, the chat could start. 

The code has not been maintained and updates to Swift might prevent it from working as expected. To see functionality of this project, see the uploaded video which demonstrates its performance.
